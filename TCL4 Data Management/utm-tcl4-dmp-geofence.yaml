    "TCL4 will require the submission of test data.  Some of these data are not
    readily collected via UTM means.  The models presented in this domain are in
    support of such data that are not readily collected otherwise.  Some of
    these data will be collected live, some after testing, but all should be
    collected as a soon as feasible.  Further details will be provided in other
    testing documentation."

      geofence_id:
        description: >-
          Identifier for this geofence data instance.  This id should remain
          constant across multiple geofence samples for a dynamic geofence.
        type: "string"
        format: "uuidv4"
        example: "00000000-0000-4444-9988-feeddeadbeef"

        description: GUFI of the operation that used this geofence.
        type: "string"
        format: "uuidv4"
        example: "00000000-0000-4444-9988-bo55beefface"
      timestamp:
        description: >-
          Time for the sample of this geofence data instance. For a static
          geofence, this may simply be any reasonable time that the geofence
          is defined and/or entered on the platform.  For dynamic geofences,
          this is the sample time for the geofence, likely during the operation
          window.
