          The reason for this report. When activated operation enters nonconforming or rogue state, includes scripted off-nominal event, or unplanned RTL, loitering, landing occurs during operation, USS must prompt operator to file at least one report when the operation closes. Reason must be one of the following Enum value, [NONCONFORMING, ROGUE, NONCONFORMING2ROGUE, UNPLANNED_RTL, UNPLANNED_LOITER, UNPLANNED_LANDING, VOLUNTEER]. NONCONFORMING means the operation closed after entering nonconforming state. When multiple nonconformances occur use the first one as the reason. ROGUE means the operation closed after entering rogue state. NONCONFORMING2ROGUE means the operation entered nonconforming state then rogue state then closed. UNPLANNED_RTL means UA made unplanned return to the launch location (e.g., due to unexpected low battery status). UNPLANNED_LOITER means UA performed unplanned loitering or hovering (e.g., to regain C2 link). UNPLANNED_LANDING means UA made unplanned landing (e.g., due to unexpected low battery status). VOLUNTEER means this report is filed in addition to USS prompted mandatory one, OR filed without USS prompt (e.g., reporter requests the form to be made available).

          emission.  In the case that no device or technology is used (maybe
          just eyeballs), something like "VISUAL" is an appropriate response.

      An instance of this model is expected for each USS-operation mapping.  The
      goal is to capture information about the volume and types of communications
      between operators and their supporting USSs.  These data are not captured
      via the USS Network, so this is a key opportunity to understand the
      potential interactions between USS and Operator.  These data will
      be correlated with data captured via the USS Network.

          that and continue operating?  If the operator needed to recognize it
