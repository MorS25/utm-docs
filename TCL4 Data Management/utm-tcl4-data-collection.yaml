          file at least one report when the operation closes.

          Must be one of the following Enum values:
          
          * **NONCONFORMING** means the operation closed after entering nonconforming state. When multiple nonconformances occur use the first one as the reason.

          * **UNPLANNED_LOITER** means UA performed unplanned loitering or hovering (e.g., to regain C2 link).
          * **UNPLANNED_LANDING** means UA made unplanned landing (e.g., due to unexpected low battery status).
          * **VOLUNTEER** means this report is filed in addition to USS prompted mandatory one, OR filed without USS prompt (e.g., reporter requests the form to be made available).
