  DaaSensor:
    description: >-
      A definition of a DAA Sensor.  Required for each sensor type used within
      any of the scenarios.  If the same type of sensor is used on multiple
      platforms, its description need only be submitted once.

      Many fields are listed as 'optional' in this model, but if values are
      known or have been indicated as required by the DMP team or documentation,
      those values are required.  Thus, the submission process of a DaaSensor
      may be indicated as error-free, the NASA team may reach out regarding
      missing fields after the submission process.
