    "TCL4 will require the submission of test data.  Some of these data are not
    readily collected via UTM means.  The models presented in this domain are in
    support of such data that are not readily collected otherwise.  Some of
    these data will be collected live, some after testing, but all should be
    collected as a soon as feasible.  Further details will be provided in other
    testing documentation."

    RemoteID:
      description: >-
        An instance of this model should be submitted every time an attempt is made
        to lookup or identify an operation via the USSNetwork. Note that this might
        mean several instances for a single gufi if several lookups are performed.
      required:
        - "remote_id"
        - "gufi"

        gufi:
          description: >-
            GUFI of the operation that is looked up.

            If the GUFI does not exist (in a non-cooperative lookup, for example)
            use 00000000-0000-4444-8888-000000000000.

        detection_technology:
          description: >-
            Brief description of technology used to detect the operation. This
            is most applicable in "broadcast" approaches where the UA is emitting
            information in some manner, thus requiring some device to detect that
            emission.  In the case that no device or technology is used (maybe
            just eyeballs), something like "VISUAL" is an appropriate response.

            Consistency is important in this field for analysis purposes, so
            use the same string whenever the same technology is used.

            Brief description of the technology used to broadcast information from

            appropriate response.

            Consistency is important in this field for analysis purposes, so
            use the same string whenever the same technology is used.
