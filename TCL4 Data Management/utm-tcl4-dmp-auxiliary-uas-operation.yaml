    "TCL4 will require the submission of test data.  Some of these data are not readily collected via UTM means.
    The models presented in this domain are in support of such data that are not readily collected otherwise.
    Some of these data will be collected live, some after testing, but all should be collected as a soon as
    feasible.  Further details will be provided in other testing documentation."

      takeoff_weight:
        description: >-
          The actual takeoff weight of the vehicle for this operation.

          Note value must be in US pounds.

          Note large maximum allows for some flexibility in vehicles that
          participate.  May re-visit this value.

          A list of identifiers indicating the types of sensors equipped. Descriptions

          Provide as an array of SensorId values (UUIDs).

          If no sensors as described by a DaaSensor model are included on this
          vehicle during this operation, supply an empty (0-length) array since
          this is a required field.
