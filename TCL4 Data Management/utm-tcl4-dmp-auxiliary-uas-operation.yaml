    "TCL4 will require the submission of test data.  Some of these data are not readily collected via UTM means.
    The models presented in this domain are in support of such data that are not readily collected otherwise.
    Some of these data will be collected live, some after testing, but all should be collected as a soon as
    feasible.  Further details will be provided in other testing documentation."

      takeoff_weight:
        description: >-
          The actual takeoff weight of the vehicle for this operation.

          Note value must be in US pounds.

          Note large maximum allows for some flexibility in vehicles that
          participate.  May re-visit this value.

      equipped_sensors:
        description: >-
          A list of identifiers indicating the types of sensors equipped. Descriptions
          of these sensors are to be provided in advance via the DaaSensor model.

          Provide as an array of DaaId values (UUIDs) representing DaaSensor.sensorId
          values that have been previously submitted. If an identifier is used in this
          array that is not previously known to the DMP system, an error may
          be thrown.

          If no sensors as described by a DaaSensor model are included on this
          vechicle during this operation, supply an empty (0-length) array since
          this is a required field.

      static_obstacle_lists:
        description: >-
          A list of identifiers indicating collections of obstacle data known
          to the UAS prior to departure.

          These identifiers map to StaticObstacleTable.staticOstacleId values
          that have been previously submitted.  If an identifier is used in this
          array that is not previously known to the DMP system, an error may
          be thrown.

      conflict_resolution_configuration:
        description: >-
          A reference to a previously submitted ConflictResolutionConfiguration via
          its conflictResolutionConfigId.

          This field is optional in this model, but it is required when the
          vehicle is implementing DAA capabilities.
