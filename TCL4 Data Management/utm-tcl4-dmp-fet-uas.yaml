      Flight essential telemetry data for a UAS Operation in TCL4. These data elements are
      in addition to the required UTM data submissions for an operation.  While the various sensor measurements
      may occur at different sampling rates, you are required to use the highest sampling rate available on your data acquisition system and use a zero-order-hold for sensor data sampled at lower sampling rates.
