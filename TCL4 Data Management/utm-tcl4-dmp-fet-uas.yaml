      Time dependent data for a UAS Operation within TCL4. These data elements are
      in addition to the required UTM data submissions for an operation.  While the various sensor measurements
      may occur at different sampling rates, you are required to use the highest sampling rate
      and use a zero-order-hold for data at lower sampling rates.
