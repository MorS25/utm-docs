    "TCL4 will require the submission of test data.  Some of these data are not
    readily collected via UTM means.  The models presented in this domain are in
    support of such data that are not readily collected otherwise.  Some of
    these data will be collected live, some after testing, but all should be
    collected as a soon as feasible.  Further details will be provided in other
    testing documentation."

          well as 12 batteries in reserve on the ground, and the vehicle is
          used in an operation with gufi 00000000-0000-4444-8888-FEEDDEADBEEF, then

          battery 3 is always the same battery.  Ideally, the operator would use
          the same battery number across all of its platforms and missions.
          This would be helpful in cases where
          there are many batteries that a UAS may employ for a given Operation and
          the set of physical batteries may vary Operation to Operation.  It also
          helps when UAS platforms may share a collection of batteries so the
          data would show how a particular battery performed across all operations
          and platforms.

          vehicles as well for this cell (i.e. always use the same mapping of cell numbers
          for a given battery.)
