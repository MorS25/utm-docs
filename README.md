# The UTM Documentation Repository

This repository is for maintaining publicly available NASA UTM documentation.  The primary audience for this repository are current NASA UTM partners or on-boarding new NASA UTM partners.  To emphasize: this repo is still not comprehensive for all partners as we are limited to posting only publicly avaialble documents here.  In addition it is not comprehensive of all materials published by the NASA UTM project.  Read on for further details on why this repo exists.
